          <h2>A Life of Discovery</h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Jane Doe's journey began in a small Midwestern town, where her
            curiosity about the natural world was evident from an early age.
            Despite facing numerous obstacles as a woman in STEM during the
            1980s, she persevered.

          <p>
            Her revolutionary approach to solar cell efficiency, developed
            during her tenure at MIT, increased energy capture by 40% while
            reducing manufacturing costs. This breakthrough made clean energy
            accessible to developing nations and earned her the Nobel Prize in
            Physics in 2015.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond her research, Dr. Doe mentored over 200 young scientists,
            founded the Global Energy Initiative, and championed science
            education in underserved communities.
